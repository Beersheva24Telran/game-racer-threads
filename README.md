# HW 43 Definition
## The same project structure
## Updating code
### Output: Instead of printing out only numer of the winner thread the applications should outline a results table
table should include following: <br>
- place <br>
- racer number<br>
- running time in milliseconds
### Notes:
- all threads have the same start time (hint: property of Race)
- each thread has its own finish time (hint: property of Racer)
